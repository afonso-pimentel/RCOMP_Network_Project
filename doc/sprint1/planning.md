RCOMP 2021-2022 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1181654 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

  * Development of a structured cabling project for building 1, encompassing the campus backbone.
  * Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.
  * Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.
  * Development of a structured cabling project for building 4.
  * Development of a structured cabling project for building 5.
# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

  * Copper cable wiring cable type will be CAT7 STP.
  * Copper cable wiring standard to be adopted is 568A.
  * Backbone cable type to be used will be multimode optic cable.
  * Cable passageways to be used between buildings will be the external underground technical ditch.
  * Cable passageways to be used in the ground floor will be the underfloor cable raceway, wall mounted cable raceway, and floor cable cover where underfloor cable raceway is not present.
  * Cable passageways to be used in the first floor will be the dropped ceiling cable, wall mounted cable raceway, and floor cable cover where underfloor cable raceway is not present.
  * Connection between main cross-connect and intermediate cross-connect will be two parallel multimode optic fiber cables managed by load balancing.
  * Connection between intermediate cross-connect and horizontal cross-connect will be two parallel CAT7 STP copper cables managed by load balancing.
  * Outlets distribution will be a minimum of 1 per 5mÂ² (where outlets are required).
  * Outlets distribution must be set in a way that wherever the user equipment is, there should always be an outlet less than 3 meters away.
  * Wi-Fi range will be 25 meters, giving a diameter of 50 meters of coverage.
  * Wi-Fi can be placed ignoring the walls and column dampening effect, but not the floor, requiring at least one access point per floor.
